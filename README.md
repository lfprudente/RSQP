## üìÇ **Contents**

### Algorithms
- **`RSQP.m`** ‚Äî RSQP with PHR (LStype=1) or ‚Ñì‚ÇÅ (LStype=2) merit function.  
- **`auglag.m`** ‚Äî Riemannian Augmented Lagrangian method using Manopt‚Äôs solvers: trust-regions (InSolver=1) or Riemannian BFGS (InSolver=2).

### RSQP Core Routines
- **`build_subproblem.m`** ‚Äî Builds the reduced quadratic subproblem in local tangent coordinates.  
- **`make_SPD.m`** ‚Äî Safeguards the reduced Hessian by ensuring positive definiteness.


### Problem Routines
- **`evalf.m`** ‚Äî Objective function.  
- **`evalg.m`** ‚Äî Euclidean gradient of the objective function.  
- **`evalh.m`** ‚Äî Euclidean Hessian of the objective function.  
- **`evalcc.m`** ‚Äî Constraints.  
- **`evalnc.m`** ‚Äî Gradients of the constraints.  
- **`evalhc.m`** ‚Äî Hessians of the constraints.  

### Main Script
- **`main.m`** ‚Äî Controls execution of the numerical experiments. The user selects the problem (nnPCA, packing, or classification) and the algorithm (RSQP-PHR, RSQP-‚Ñì‚ÇÅ, AL-TR, or AL-BFGS).
